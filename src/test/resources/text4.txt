"A perfect vantage point"

Sprawled on the hospital roof,
you watch as bandaged invalids are
wheeled into the ward and left in rows.
Before the night is out, a spirifer comes to call at their bedsides.
He is an unnerving sight; eyes like yellow diamonds,
a mouth like a slash in a rubber sheet,
and the most unnaturally enormous hat.

He leans over a bedside,
and, with a device like a brass tuning fork,
gently winds the soul from an invalid's mouth.

It is a simple matter to follow him home.
A quick tap on the back of the head with your trusty knoblolly and he falls stunned.
You resist the urge to murder him and help yourself to his stock instead.
