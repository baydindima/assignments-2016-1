"The pearls!"

The thieves are long gone,
but you track down the moon-pearls to a dingy pawnbroker's shop in Spite.
The foul-mouthed owner isn't keen on returning them,
but capitulates when you mention the Constables.
The Keen-Eyed Lapidary is greatly relieved by their return:
but the pearls are all spoken for,
and she has no funds to reward you.
She promises to return the favour in future.
