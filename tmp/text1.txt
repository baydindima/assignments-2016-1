"The Burden of Truth"

The Comtessa's father sits with impeccable posture.
An empty bottle of port rests on his desk;
his empty strong box still rests on the floor.

barely visible in the light of the dying hearth.

"You must have encountered many distressing sights,
in your work. How do you live with what you know?"
